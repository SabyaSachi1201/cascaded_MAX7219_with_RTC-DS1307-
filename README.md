# cascaded_MAX7219_with_RTC-DS1307-
**************************************************************************************************************
@Back Story: This project holds a special place in my heart.
This project was assigned to me as a part of a prototyping challenge, where I had to interface sensor, write the code and build the desired application, within a very short time span of just 2 days! 
This was before chatGPT was a thing, so you can only imagine, finding relevant code was like finding needle in a haystack. 
I chose to build this on the Arduino platform, because of it's rich availability of libraries and the lack of time. 
I would say, this project's success and my mentor's words, were what ultimately encouraged me to take up embedded systems and led me to believe that I was capable of building things, that I had what it takes to be an engineer. 
I remember working alone, sitting day and night, on New Year's to understand whatever reference I found on the internet, and build and test my code on my hardware. It took me time, but I was ultimately able to figure out how to get the hardware running, mostly because I didn't have experience working with the MAX7219 display and couldn't make any sense of the resources I found online earlier.

Today, I'm much more well-versed and have dived headfirst, significantly deeper, into Embedded Systems, and it all started here.

About the project : 
Building a simple RTC based application, displaying the date and time on the MAX7219  display that would keep on looping a Message, show a greeting and then show Date in DD/MM/YY format and then the time, and keep on looping over .

This project is to make a realtime clock , using the 7219 dot-matrix display as the display.
Here I will be using Parola Library .
The hardware requirements for this project are : 
1. Arduino UNO.
2. RTC DS1307.
3. MAX 7219.
4. Jumper wires.
